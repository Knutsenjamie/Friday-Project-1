  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Jamie Knutsen. If there's anything important to know about me, it's that I've got a huge passion for food. Not just any food, but making vegan food taste good. I've been a vegan chef for over 5 years, and have always been very passionate about it. I graduated from <a href="https://www.cptc.edu/">Clover Park Technical College</a> back in 2018 with an AA in Culinary Arts. While I had a good run professionally as a chef (I became a kitchen manager fresh out of school), COVID hit and the restaurant industry took a pretty huge blow. I became unemployed for quite some time. During that up-in-the-air period; wondering what I could do with my skills, I created my own vegan food blog with my own recipes. I studied, learned some basic coding, and created my own wordpress site and opened my own LLC with all self-taught experience. It was definitely not easy! I even bought camera equiptment and studied legal background so that I knew what I was doing. Thus, my baby <a href="https://vitallyveg.com">VitallyVeg.com</a> was born! After taking care of my site for almost a year, and still havig no leads for the restuarant industry <strong>or</strong> income, I knew it was time to start anew. I thought to myself; why not expand on some coding skills to not only get a more secure source of income, but also better my own site and business? These are the reasons as to why I knew Epicodus would be the perfect fit. It's been a great journey thus far!</p>

  <h2>Project's I've Created</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/cupcakeshop">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This was a fun project using html, css, <strong>and</strong> css classes!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/wiggles.git">Wiggles</a></li>
      <p>This was a <em>pretty</em> hilarious project. However: it was great practice for html, css, and using the css box model!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/animal-shelter-website.git">Animal Shelter Website</a></li>
      <p>This sample site was great practice for html, css, and css column styling!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/Mar-vacation.git">Vacation Website</a></li>
      <p>This sample site used html, css, and bootstrap to give it that sleek look!</p>
    </ul>
  <h2>Top 3 Favorite Projects So Far</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/wiggles.git">Wiggles</a></li>
      <p>This has to be my favorite sample site I created. It was funny yet informative at the same time.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/cupcakeshop.git">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This site has to be my second favorite. Not only is this site funny too, but as a foodie I couldn't <em>resist</em> having one of my top favorite sites I've created this far be about food!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/Free-time-projects.git">Resort Project</a></li>
      <p>This project is my third favorite. While it may be bare-bones, it was the first site I created in school from scratch without using the learn how to program prompts!</p>
