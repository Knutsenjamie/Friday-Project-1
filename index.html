  <h2>Project's I've Created</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/cupcakeshop">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This was a fun project using html, css, <strong>and</strong> css classes!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/wiggles.git">Wiggles</a></li>
      <p>This was a <em>pretty</em> hilarious project. However: it was great practice for html, css, and using the css box model!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/animal-shelter-website.git">Animal Shelter Website</a></li>
      <p>This sample site was great practice for html, css, and css column styling!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/Mar-vacation.git">Vacation Website</a></li>
      <p>This sample site used html, css, and bootstrap to give it that sleek look!</p>
    </ul>
  <h2>Top 3 Favorite Projects So Far</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/wiggles.git">Wiggles</a></li>
      <p>This has to be my favorite sample site I created. It was funny yet informative at the same time.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/cupcakeshop.git">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>This site has to be my second favorite. Not only is this site funny too, but as a foodie I couldn't <em>resist</em> having one of my top favorite sites I've created this far be about food!</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Knutsenjamie/Free-time-projects.git">Resort Project</a></li>
      <p>This project is my third favorite. While it may be bare-bones, it was the first site I created in school from scratch without using the learn how to program prompts!</p>
    </ol> 
    <p>my favorite color is <span style="color: aqua;">blue</span></p>
